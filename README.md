# Natural Language Processing - 
Natural language processing means a computer processes the language spoken by use and then forms a comprehension from them.

# ðŸ§  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) using Python
This Code demonstrates how to implement basic **NLU (Natural Language Understanding)** and **NLG (Natural Language Generation)** using Python libraries: **spaCy** and **HuggingFace Transformers (GPT-2)**.

### ðŸ”¹ What is NLU?

**Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** allows machines to comprehend human language. It involves:
- **Intent recognition**: Understanding what the user wants (e.g., book a flight)
- **Entity extraction**: Identifying key information like names, places, dates, etc.
- **Context analysis**: Understanding sentence structure and meaning

### ðŸ”¹ What is NLG?

**Natural Language Generation (NLG)** creates human-readable text from structured data or prompts. It is used in:
- Text generation
- Chatbots
- Summarization
- Dialogue systems
